    "In October 2015, data journalist Walt Hickey discovered than the movie ratings on the [Fandango]() website were inflated by biased rounding. Instead of being rounded to the nearest half-star the ratings were rounded up. In some cases the ratings were even rounded up one whole star. Fandango later released a statement saying the rounding was an unintentional bug in the system that has now been fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will investigate whether Fandango's ratings are still biased. We will use Hickey's original dataset and a new dataset collected by Dataquest for movies released in 2016 and 2017."
